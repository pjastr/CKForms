# GAP Package CKForms

The CKForms package is used for finding standard compact Clifford-Klein forms of a non-compact homogeneous space $G/H$ where $G$ is a simple linear Lie group and $H$ is a non-compact reductive Lie subgroup of $G$.

The current version of this package is version 1.0, released on 2019-01-11. For more information, please refer to the package [manual](manual.html). There is also a [README](readme.html) file. 

## Dependencies
This package requires GAP version >=4.10.

The following other GAP packages are needed:

* sla >=1.2
* CoReLG >=1.20

## Abstract
In this package we develop algorithms generating triples $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l})$ of lie algebras ($\mathfrak{h}$ and $\mathfrak{l}$ are subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$) such that the corresponding triples of Lie groups $(G,H,L)$ fulfill some necessary conditions required for triples inducing standard compact Clifford-Klein forms. The program is used for searching for standard compact Cliiford-Klein forms.
